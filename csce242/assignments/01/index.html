        <h2>A Little About the Super Bowl</h2>
        <p>
            The Super Bowl grosses over 14 billion dollars annually. The way that the teams that play in the 
            Super Bowl are selected is pretty similar to a regular tournament style. There are 2 confrences
            in the NFL; the AFC and the NFC. Throughout the season based on each team's win-loss record they
            are given a seed in the playoffs. After the playoffs the two remaning teams (one from each confrence)
            are the teams that play in the Super Bowl. For a list of all of the previous Super Bowl winners and
            more information about it click the image below.
